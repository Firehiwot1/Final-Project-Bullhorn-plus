Final Project –Bullhorn plus

I wrote an application that is kind of like Twitter. It will allow a user to post a message, and everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted.
Features/Functionalities:

•	The index page shall display a list of all messages
•	Users shall sign up using a registration page
•	Users shall be logged in to create a post or edit a post
•	Users shall be permitted to edit only their own posts
•	Every page (or template) should have a link (or button) to add a new message. This link shall be visible only when the user is logged in
•	There shall be a link to Logout which, when clicked, logs out the user and redirects them to the login page. This link shall only be visible when the user is logged in.
•	Implement Bootstrap to make the site look good
•	Use a MySQL database or h2 to store your messages
•	Pre-loading data is recommended but not required. You probably want to modify the data loader to execute only once.
•	Display the logged in username on every page (or in the navigation menu) where they are logged in.
•	Each user shall have a profile.
•	Each user get a gravatar image.
